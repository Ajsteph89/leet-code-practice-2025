# Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

# Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.


# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].

# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: You must delete one element.
