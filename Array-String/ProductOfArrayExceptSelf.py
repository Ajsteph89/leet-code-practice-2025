# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
# Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

nums = [1,2,3,4]
